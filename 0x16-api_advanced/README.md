# 0x16. API Advanced

This project involves interacting with the Reddit API to practice API queries, recursive functions, and data handling. The tasks require querying subreddit information and handling the results appropriately.

## Background Context

Questions involving APIs are common in technical interviews. They often require writing Python scripts to query endpoints, use recursive functions, and format or sort results. The Reddit API is a great resource for practice due to its extensive endpoints and public access without requiring authentication.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Read API documentation to find the endpoints you need.
- Use an API with pagination.
- Parse JSON results from an API.
- Make recursive API calls.
- Sort a dictionary by value.

## Requirements

- All scripts must be executable.
- Your code should follow PEP 8 style.
- Use the `requests` library for HTTP requests.
- Do not publish any content of this project.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden.

- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

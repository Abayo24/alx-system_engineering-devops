Project Title: Bash Scripting - 0x04: Loops, Conditions, and Parsing
Introduction
This project focuses on strengthening your Bash scripting skills by tackling tasks related to loops, conditions, and parsing. Each task is designed to reinforce concepts such as creating SSH keys, using various loop structures, implementing conditional statements, and mastering essential commands like cut and file-related operators.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

Create SSH keys for secure access.
Understand the advantages of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash.
Effectively use while, until, and for loops in Bash scripting.
Implement if, else, elif, and case condition statements for decision-making.
Master the cut command for text manipulation.
Use file-related operators and other comparison operators for efficient scripting.
Ensure script portability by making scripts compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
All Bash script files must be executable
Do not use awk
Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any errors
The first line of all Bash scripts should be #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose
Copyright - Plagiarism
Solutions must be developed independently
Do not publish any content of this project
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program
Shellcheck
Shellcheck is a valuable tool to ensure the correctness of your Bash scripts. It provides recommendations on syntax and semantics, helping you write proper and error-free scripts. Ensure that all your Bash scripts pass Shellcheck without any errors.

For every feedback, Shellcheck will provide a code that you can use to get more information about the issue. Refer to the Shellcheck Wiki for additional details.

Tasks Overview
The following tasks are designed to enhance your understanding of Bash scripting concepts:

Create a SSH RSA key pair
For Best School loop
While Best School loop
Until Best School loop
If 9, say Hi!
4 bad luck, 8 is your chance
Superstitious numbers
Clock
For ls
To file, or not to file
FizzBuzz
Note: Each task should have its corresponding Bash script file in the project directory.

Conclusion
This project is an opportunity to apply and solidify your knowledge of Bash scripting. Emphasize script correctness, portability, and adherence to the specified requirements. Good luck, and happy scripting!
